# csb-extras
Extras to compliment WillySR's Cinnamon SlackBuilds

These are completely experimental, kludged together and will probably break your system if not entirely blow up your computer. No warranty or guarantees are implied or given.

You will need; <a href="https://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.2/libraries/libcryptui/?search=libcryptui">libcryptui</a>, <a href="https://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.2/python/python-distutils-extra/?search=python-distutils">python-distutils-extras</a> and <a href="https://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.2/development/docutils/?search=docutils">docutils</a> installed.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Now that that is out of the way,

These addons or extras will add some functionality and style to the Cinnamon SlackBuilds by WillySR that can be found here:

If you look at the scripts you will notice that I am not very good at building SlackBuild scripts, so tips, pointers and tutoring appreciated and welcomed.<br>
