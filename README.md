Extras to compliment WillySR's Cinnamon SlackBuilds

These are completely experimental, kludged together and will probably break your system if not entirely blow up your computer.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Now that that is out of the way,

These addons or extras will add some functionality to the Cinnamon SlackBuilds (development branch) by WillySR that can be found here:

https://github.com/willysr/csb/tree/development

They include;

 * The sound scheme from Linux Mint 17.3 Cinnamon
 * Mint GTK3 themes (Window borders etc.)
 * Mint themes
 * Mint "x" icons
 * Nemo folder emblems
 * Nemo file-roller extension
 * Nemo python
 * And more to come......
