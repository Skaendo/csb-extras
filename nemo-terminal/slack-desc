# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

nemo-terminal: Nemo Terminal follows your navigation in a shell accessible by
nemo-terminal: hotkey (F4, by default) in a resizeable pane in Nemo. It eliminates
nemo-terminal: the grunt work of navigating multiple folder levels just to run a
nemo-terminal: single shell command and cuts down on window clutter from multiple
nemo-terminal: terminals and file managers.
